# OpenAI API

The goal of these API structs is to define a standard API for interfacing with models using OpenAI-compatible APIs.

* JSON-to-struct-to-JSON round trip is not guaranteed. This package strives to preserve semantic meaning during JSON round trips.
* Use the `https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json` pkg (the WIP implementation of stdlib json v2), not the stdlib `encoding/json` pkg.
  * NOTE: `We have confidence in the correctness and performance of the module as it has been used internally at Tailscale in various production services. However, the module is an experiment and breaking changes are expected to occur based on feedback in this discussion` - https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/63397
  * Used to preserve unknown fields while staying close to the stdlib.
* Extra fields at the root of requests/responses should be preserved (supports additional fields that engines like vLLM support - see [vLLM docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html#extra-parameters)).

## API References

API References (useful for AI generation) were generated using:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/refs/heads/master/openapi.yaml -O ./tmp/openaiapi.yaml

# Filter down to only the relevant components.
# This allows you to focus an AI coding assistant on
# a specific part of the API.
./hack/filter-openapi-components.py ./tmp/openaiapi.yaml /completions post -o ./api/openai/v1/reference/completions.openai.openapi.yaml
./hack/filter-openapi-components.py ./tmp/openaiapi.yaml /chat/completions post -o ./api/openai/v1/reference/chat_completions.openai.openapi.yaml
./hack/filter-openapi-components.py ./tmp/openaiapi.yaml /embeddings post -o ./api/openai/v1/reference/embeddings.openai.openapi.yaml
```

## Example Requests/Responses

This example script was generated from the OpenAI OpenAPI specs.

```bash
# To redact API keys from the output, pipe the script through sed:
redact_keys() {
  sed -E 's/Bearer [^"]*"/Bearer REDACTED"/g; s/(Bearer [^ ]*)/Bearer REDACTED/g'
}

# Ollama
OPENAI_API_KEY=placeholder OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434 \
  COMPLETIONS_MODEL=qwen2:0.5b \
  CHAT_MODEL=qwen2:0.5b \
  EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=all-minilm \
  ./reference/example-requests.sh 2>&1 | redact_keys > ./reference/example-requests.ollama.output

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com \
  COMPLETIONS_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct \
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini \
  EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002 \
  ./reference/example-requests.sh 2>&1 | redact_keys > ./reference/example-requests.openai.output

# vLLM
OPENAI_API_KEY=placeholder OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/openai \
  COMPLETIONS_MODEL=deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b-l4 \
  CHAT_MODEL=deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b-l4 \
  ./reference/example-requests.sh 2>&1 | redact_keys > ./reference/example-requests.vllm.output
```

Note: The redaction step above ensures no sensitive API keys are included in the output files.

## Concerns

When developing, pay special attention to the following:

- Zero-value types missmatching with default values in the API.
- Pointer types and optional types.
- Nullable types.
